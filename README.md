# LangChain & LangGraph AI Agents (Hands-On)

This repository contains hands-on implementations of **AI agents** built using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**, leveraging **open-source LLMs** for reasoning, tool execution, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-step **AI agent workflows** using LangChain and LangGraph
- **State-based agent orchestration** and control flow with LangGraph
- Integration with **open-source LLMs** (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral via Hugging Face)
- **Tool calling** for API, utility, and data source interaction
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using vector embeddings
- **Conversational memory** and context management
- Logging and error handling for agent execution tracking

## 🧠 Use Cases
- Autonomous AI agents
- Question answering over documents
- Multi-tool reasoning pipelines
- LLM experimentation with open-source models

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- LangChain  
- LangGraph  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Open-source LLMs  

## 📌 Purpose
This project is intended for **learning and experimentation** with modern **GenAI agent architectures**, focusing on practical, production-inspired patterns.
